<p>  WHAT IS FASHION DESGINING ? <br>
    Fashion design is a form of art dedicated to the creation of clothing and other lifestyle accessories. 
    Modern fashion design is divided into two basic categories: haute couture and ready-to-wear.
    The haute couture collection is dedicated to certain customers and is custom sized to fit these customers exactly.
    In order to qualify as a haute couture house, a designer has to be part of the Syndical Chamber for Haute Couture 
    and show a new collection twice a year presenting a minimum of 35 different outfits each time.<br>
    Ready-to-wear collections are standard sized, not custom made, so they are more suitable for large production runs. 
    They are also split into two categories: designer/createur and confection collections.
    Designer collections have a higher quality and finish as well as an unique design. 
    They often represent a certain philosophy and are created to make a statement rather than for sale.
    Both ready-to-wear and haute-couture collections are presented on international catwalks.</p>
